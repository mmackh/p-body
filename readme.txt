Welcome to my second attempt at building some form of static
blog generation software - this time using Markdown!

To start your blog, copy all the files to your server's home direcotry.

Name your first post: 1-Tile Goes Here.txt
Second: 2-Hi there, I work with question marks?.txt
Thrid: 3-You probably get the idea ...

Thus: [number]-[Title].txt

-> Upload them to the 'raw' directroy

Fill yout all the variables in the top section of generate.php (author, twitter, website)

All finished? Navigate to http://yourserver.com/generate.php!
